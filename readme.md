# ðŸ§© Complex Systems Simulations

This is a curated collection of **complex systems** and **agent-based modeling (ABM)** projects â€” a sandbox for exploring emergent phenomena, dynamical behaviors, and foundational computational models.  
Each subfolder hosts a standalone simulation with code, configuration and visualization.

This repository covers several domains of complex systems.

|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
|[Schelling Segregation](https://github.com/FarshadAmiri/complex-systems-simulations/tree/main/schelling-abm) | Demonstrates how individual local preferences lead to emergent large-scale spatial segregation patterns. |
|[Predator-Prey](https://github.com/FarshadAmiri/complex-systems-simulations/tree/main/predator-prey)     | Models dynamic interactions between predators and prey, showcasing population oscillations and spatial complexity. |
|[Conway's Game of Life](https://github.com/FarshadAmiri/complex-systems-simulations/tree/main/conway-game-of-life)          | Classic 2D cellular automaton illustrating how simple rules produce complex emergent behavior. |
|[Cultural Evolution](https://github.com/FarshadAmiri/complex-systems-simulations/tree/main/cultural-evolution) | Simulates how cultural traits evolve through social learning, environmental adaptation, and innovation in human populations. |
|[Social Learning Network](https://github.com/FarshadAmiri/complex-systems-simulations/tree/main/social-learning-network) | Models knowledge spread through dynamic social networks with agents learning, teaching, and collaborating based on personality traits. |
|[Busy Beaver](https://github.com/FarshadAmiri/complex-systems-simulations/tree/main/busy-beaver) | Explores the limits of computation by finding the maximum number of ones (Î£(n)) and maximum steps (S(n)) for a given n-state halting Turing machine.|
